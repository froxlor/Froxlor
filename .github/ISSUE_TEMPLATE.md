# Bug report vs. support request

If you're unsure of whether your problem is a bug or a configuration error
* contact us via IRC in #froxlor on irc.libera.chat
* or post a thread in our forum at https://forum.froxlor.org

As a rule of thumb: before reporting an issue

* see if it hasn't been [reported](https://github.com/Froxlor/froxlor/issues) (and possibly already been [fixed](https://github.com/Froxlor/froxlor/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is:issue%20is:closed)) first
* try with the git master
