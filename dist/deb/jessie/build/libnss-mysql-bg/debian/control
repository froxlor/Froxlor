Description: NSS module for using MySQL as a naming service
 libnss-mysql-bg provides a Name Service Switch module that allows MySQL
 to act as a name service.
 .
 Its configuration is very flexible by allowing to set an SQL query per NSS
 call (getpwnam, getpwuid, ...). You would use it instead of the other
 "libnss-mysql" package for building an NSS over an existing database (used for
 another purpose like groupware, ...).
 .
 It currently supports storage of passwd, group and shadow information.
